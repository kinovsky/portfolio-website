            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Vela is a responsive web app dedicated to providing easy to understand and intuitive displays
                for real-time weather, wave, and wind conditions, as well as forecasts and reports. The
                application sets itself apart from its competition by including safety info, as well as
                recommendations for nearby amenities and attractions for users.
            </p>
            <div class="column col-md-6 col-lg-6 col-xl-4">
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Users need simple access to a variety of weather-based information that will keep them informed and safe
                while at the beach or out on the water. Many weather apps can confuse and stress out new users, lacking
                easy-to-read displays or educational information they need to understand terms pertaining to the
                information they seek. Users also may not be familiar with safety precautions they need to take in order
                to stay safe during their activities or when inclement weather affects them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column col-md-6 col-lg-6 col-xl-4">   
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>An app that grabs from reliable weather API to forecast weather, wind, and waves, but also allows users
                to submit live updates when sudden shifts in conditions happen in their location. A user-friendly
                interface will aid users in better understanding complex weather terms and reports rather than confusing
                or intimidating them and instead, will put them at ease while engaging in their activities. Vela will
                provide safety information and step-by-step guides in the event of an emergency while on the beach or on
                the water.</p>

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>In order to better understand the weather-based application space, I analyzed numerous weather-based apps
                for their key objectives, strategies, market advantage, UX/UI design, and SWOT profiles. These apps
                range from ones that strive to be general use for just about any user to utilize, or attempt to fill a
                niche for particular professions or hobbies, such as surfers, fishers, drone pilots, etc. I chose to
                focus on the top-rated apps on the iOS and Google Play store, along with apps mentioned by users that
                were interviewed or responded to a Google survey. Two key apps I chose to focus on were Windy.app and
                Windy.com.</p>

            <h2>User Interviews & Survey</h2>
            <div class="row">
            <p>Over the course of a week, I interviewed 4 individuals to better understand their history with
                weather-based apps and how they come into play in their everyday lives. Once completed, I created an
                affinity map to better organize my findings for later reference. The goals of these interviews were to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Discover how users plan their beach trips and activities around weather conditions.</li>
                <li>Determine strengths and weaknesses of existing apps.</li>
                <li>Identify user wants and goals when using these apps.</li>
                <li>Understanding their biggest pain points and how they can be addressed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While interviews were being conducted, I sent out a survey to various social media channels to gain more
                feedback from a variety of users and get a bigger picture of who I might be designing for and gain
                additional perspectives on userâ€™s experiences with weather apps. Below are affinity maps of the
                responses I received from my user interviews, organized and color coded to refer back to easily.</p>

            <h4>Key Insights</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Most users complain that the weather apps they commonly use can be unreliable and untrustworthy
                    whether the information is incorrect, data is missing, or usability is frustrating.</li>
                <li>Most users want information for nearby attractions, restaurants, shops, and parking close to beaches
                    and water activity spots.</li>
                <li>Safety is important, even to the most stubborn user, to fall back on when in doubt.</li>
                <li>Weather, wind, crowds, air quality, and waves/tides were the most popular choices that might impact
                    a user's decision to partake in their beach trips or activities.</li>

        <div id="personas_flows">
            <h2>User Personas & Flows</h2>
            <div class="row">
            <p>With competitive analysis and user interviews wrapped up, I developed user personas that represent Velaâ€™s
                target audience in order to empathize with the appâ€™s key users and better understand their problems and
                goals and how they can be addressed. I crafted 2 key personas (Thelma & Joe) based on the product
                requirements, as well as an outlier persona (Darrell) for edge cases.</p>
            <p>To better align user needs with business goals, I fleshed out journey maps to ideate the navigation
                structure of the Vela application prior to creating a sitemap and wireframing. Each persona possesses
                unique goals and needs, so it was integral that the application properly address these aspects of our
                users.</p>

            <p>In order to validate my design choices and navigational structure, or discover opportunities to make
                improvements, an unmoderated Open Sort exercise was conducted using Optimal Workshop. A link to the
                exercise was shared with family, friends, and various Slack and Discord spaces. Using the best merge
                method, I retooled the foundation of Vela accordingly.</p>

            <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>With a refined sitemap, it came time to bring my design ideas to life. With the business goals, user
                needs, and navigational structure in mind, I used Adobe Photoshop, a Wacom Intuos tablet, and the brush
                tool to sketch out what the Vela app would roughly look like, creating the foundation of what would
                later become a high-fidelity, clickable prototype.</p>

            <div>
            <p>Transitioning to Adobe XD, I translated my low-fidelity sketches into mid-fidelity wireframes. Switching
                to this platform presented many opportunities to refine the design in real-time, discover numerous
                improvement opportunities off the bat, and reassessing the foundation of the design. Once these
                wireframes were assembled, it was time to add in UI elements and really give the application life for
                the first time.</p>

            <h3>High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
            <p>After I felt comfortable with the structure of my mid-fidelity wireframes, it was time to create a
                clickable high-fidelity prototype that included all the applicationâ€™s main features and allowed users to
                perform all the appâ€™s key functions. This step included incorporating UI elements, including color,
                icons, copy, and animations. This is the version of the app that was used for usability testing.</p>

                Participants were given 5 tasks to complete during our meetings and were encouraged to think out loud
                when navigating through the app in order for me to gauge their feelings, emotions, and behaviors
                throughout the process. At the conclusion of testing, I created an affinity map and rainbow spreadsheet
                to analyze the results, and used Jakob Nielsenâ€™s severity scale to determine what improvements were the
                most urgent to address moving forward. Below is the affinity map analyzing the results of each testing
                session, color coded by the respondees.</p>

            <h3>Preference Testing</h3>
            <p>After making a few changes to key wireframes, a preference test was conducted through Helio and sent
                directly to friends and family, along with multiple social channels; a total of 30 responses were
                recorded and analyzed. Users were asked to choose between variations of the appâ€™s Splash Screen,
                Sign-Up, and Dashboard. The results from the usability and preference tests would influence how I
                approached the redesign of the application moving forward.</p>

            <h2>Refining the Design</h2>
            <div class="row">
            <p>At the conclusion of both usability and preference testing, I went back to the high-fidelity prototype to
                make further revisions, keeping in mind the pain points, frustrations, dead ends, and mistakes that
                users experienced while using Vela for the first time. This also gave me the opportunity to make changes
                based on elements of Material Design, emotional design, grids, and spacing. Before and afters of the
                splash screen and home page are shown below.</p>

            <h3>UI Style Guide</h3>
            <p>In order to convey the design to an engineering team and shareholders who are not working on the project,
                I created a UI Style Guide to showcase specific design aspects of the product, including colors,
                typography, iconography, navigation, imagery, and basic guidelines.</p>

            <h3>Design Language</h3>
            <p>With the UI Style Guide listing the set of standards expected for the overall product, I took to creating
                a Design Language System that dives more in depth and provides a guide for the overall aesthetics and
                style for a single platform.</p>

            <p>In order to cater Vela to meet the needs of the visually impaired, accessibility features including
                screen reader, monochrome mode, and pinch to zoom were included to streamline their experience. Each
                feature can be accessed via the Settings tab, and once active, will display an icon at the top of the
